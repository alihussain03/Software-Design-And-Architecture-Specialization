## üìå Specialization Overview

This repository is dedicated to following the **Software Design and Architecture** specialization offered on Coursera.

The specialization can be accessed at the following link:  
[Software Design and Architecture Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-design-architecture).

The specialization consists of four courses, each further divided into modules.

## üìö Courses in the Specialization

### 1. Object-Oriented Design

This course focuses on applying object-oriented design principles to create flexible and scalable software systems.

#### Module 1: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

- **Object-oriented modeling** involves representing real-world concepts as objects in software, encapsulating their
  attributes and behaviors.
    - By using objects to represent things in your code, the code stays organized, flexible, and reusable.
    - A good exercise to help you start object-oriented thinking is to look at the room around you and identify what
      might be objects.

- **Software Development Process**  
  Software development follows an iterative process that transforms requirements into design and implementation,
  ensuring a well-structured and tested solution.

    - **Requirement Elicitation:**
        - Requirements define what a product must achieve based on client needs.
        - Effective elicitation involves probing beyond the initial vision to clarify scope, uncover hidden needs, and
          identify trade-offs.
    - **User Stories:**
        - A **user story** describes a software feature from the perspective of the end user.
        - The standard format is:  
          **"As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."**
        - Example:  
          **"As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it."**
        - User stories help break down complex requirements into small, actionable tasks for development.

    - **Design Phase:**  
      Once the initial set of requirements is established, the next step is to produce:
        - **Conceptual Design** ‚Äì High-level mock-ups. identify components, connections, and responsibilities.
        - **Technical Design** ‚Äì Detailed architecture diagrams. There are many design techniques that may be used to
          get the most
          out of the design process. The rest of this specialization will examine
          those techniques.

    - **Balancing Trade-offs in Design:**
        - Compromise is essential to balance client needs with technical constraints.
        - Constant communication and feedback help refine conceptual designs before coding begins, preventing costly
          rework.
        - Larger systems require more design time, breaking down components into manageable parts.

- **Design for Quality Attributes**
    - **Trade-offs**
    - **Context**
    - **Satisfying Qualities**

- Categories of Objects in Design
    - Entity Objects: Represent core business data or concepts, often corresponding to real-world entities (e.g., a
      Customer or Product object).
    - Boundary Objects: Manage interactions between the system and external actors, such as user interfaces or APIs (
      e.g., a LoginForm or REST API Controller).
    - Control Objects: Handle business logic and coordinate interactions between entity and boundary objects (e.g., an
      OrderProcessor or PaymentManager).

- **Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) Model**  
  During conceptual design, it is useful to identify components, responsibilities, and connections through CRC cards.

#### Module 2: Object-Oriented Modeling

This module will also explore how to express design structure in Java code and UML class diagrams using the principles
of abstraction, encapsulation, generalization and decomposition.

- **Four Design Principles**
    - **Abstraction**
        - Abstraction simplifies a concept by focusing on essential details while ignoring unimportant ones, within a
          specific context. It should follow the rule of least astonishment, meaning it should capture essential
          attributes and behaviors without surprises or unnecessary definitions.
            - Context is crucial in forming an abstraction because it influences what characteristics are considered
              essential. For example, defining the essential traits of a 'person' can be challenging without context
            - The essential characteristics of an abstraction can be understood in two ways: through fundamental
              attributes and core behaviors or responsibilities.
    - **Encapsulation**
        - This principle involves encapsulating data within a structure, allowing some parts to be accessed externally
          while keeping others hidden
        - There are three ideas behind encapsulation.
            - The ability to bundle attributes (data) and behaviors (functions that manipulate the data) into a
              self-contained object.
            - The ability to expose certain data and functions, making them accessible to other objects, typically
              through an interface.
            - The ability to restrict access to specific data and functions, allowing them to be used only within the
              object.
    - **Generalization**
        - In object-oriented modeling, generalization is a key design principle. Beyond creating methods that can be
          applied to different data, object-oriented modeling achieves generalization through inheritance. It involves
          identifying common, repeated, or shared characteristics among two or more classes and extracting them into a
          separate class.
            - In Java, generalization is primarily implemented using
                - Inheritance: A subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass, promoting code
                  reusability.
                - Interfaces: Define a contract that multiple classes can implement, allowing for flexible and scalable
                  design.
    - **Decomposition**
        - It involves breaking down a whole into smaller, manageable parts. Alternatively, decomposition can also refer
          to combining separate parts with different functionalities to form a complete system. It helps in simplifying
          complex problems, making them easier to understand and solve. it can be achieved using 3 ways.
            - Aggregation: Dividing the whole into parts that can exist independently, yet still work together (e.g., a
              university having multiple departments).
            - Composition: Breaking down a system into parts that are tightly coupled, where the whole and parts cannot
              exist without each other (e.g., a car with an engine, where the car depends on the engine).
            - Association: Establishing loose relationships between objects, where parts can function independently but
              are linked to work together (e.g., a driver driving a car).
